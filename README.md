# Introducing Twirl

Twirl (Text-to-World-IRL) is a new, groundbreaking AI-powered tool that empowers anyone to create 3D models of items in their daily lives without any need for artistic skill. Twirl translates traditional text to real life objects, an idea that revolutionizes how we think about traditional 3D model generation.

Inspired by the theme of perspectives, we wanted to create a tool that expands our perspective beyond the dimension given to the model. If given text, this can be thought as being in the 1D realm, and being able to translate this to a 3D model of that description expands the horizons of the traditional limitations of text. The same goes for 2D images of objects, which Twirl can generate a 3D representation of in a matter of seconds.
